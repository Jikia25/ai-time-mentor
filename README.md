## 🔒 Privacy

- **All data stays local** - stored in your browser using Chrome's storage API
- **No external servers** - extension code runs entirely in your browser
- **No tracking** - your browsing patterns never leave your device
- **AI is optional** - works great without AI, AI features require your chosen provider
- **You control AI data** - only aggregated stats sent to AI, never raw URLs or personal info
- **API keys secure** - stored locally in browser, never transmitted to third parties
- **Open source** - inspect the code yourself!

See [AI_SETUP.md](ai-time-mentor/AI_SETUP.md) for details on AI privacy.

## 📊 Emotion Detection Algorithm

The extension uses a heuristic-based approach to detect focus and emotional patterns:

1. **Focus Score**: Ratio of productive to total active time
2. **Stress Level**: Calculated from tab switch rate, typing intensity, and sentiment
3. **Mood Detection**: Categorizes into focused, calm, frustrated, tired, restless, or mixed
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes text patterns (if consent given)
